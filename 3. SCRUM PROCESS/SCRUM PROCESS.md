This is an agile development methodology.

collecting all the requirements as user story.

User Story - Just features which the users want, but it is written in their terms. you basically look at how do you want to have the features in place from the users standpoint. The  vision is what you want to have in the end as a working product.



Product Backlog - based on the users stories you now add items. these are kind of your to do list for the application development. To fulfills these user stories, these are added onto product backlog. This is managed by product owner or the product manager.



Selected Product Backlog - then you start taking a selected set of these items that needs to be done from the product backlog.



Sprint - selected set of items that need to be done from the product backlog. Sprint is a entire process about taking thsoe items, developing the application with those item, testing the items. Deploying the application with those times. It lasts for 2-4 weeks.

Sprint Review - here the team showcases what was done in the sprint. Here the decision can be made as to whether the deliverable should be promoted to production.



Sprint Retrospective - The team comes together to see what worked and what did not.

Instead of spending a month and gathering the requirements, a month to analyze the requirements, a month to design based on the analyses, here on continual basis you are taking user stories from users. you create items based on the stories, known as product backlog, then a team to picks out important items, from PB, then put them in to Sprint PB. These are the items to be implemented. Within that 2 week period small min-project is carried out and then it is deployed. Once the sprint is complete entire process will be stating again. You pick out the next item form the PB. You will have next item.
