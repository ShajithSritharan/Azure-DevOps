Due to inherent problems with waterfall Model, Agile methodology was born.

In a nutshell, Agile is a iterative process, wherein you go through the requirements, you then do the design, development,  testing, deployment and review.

In Agile practice, you take an entire project and break into pieces, and you tackle each piece one by one. Each piece is an entire cycle (gathering requirements, doing the design, development, testing, deployment and review.)

In agile practice, here you have self-organizing and cross-functional teams, wherein you have people from different functional areas working together as a team when it comes on to  building an application. Also, there is a close coordination of collaboration between teams, the customers, and end users.

Entire purpose of Agile is early delivery of the software. it not the software at the end of the project. It is software in increments. So you have an initial deployment of the software and then you build on the software in increments and then give it  to the end users.

Here you have continual improvement on the software, if there any sort of change in requirements or understanding you can be more flexible on how you respond to  the enduser.
