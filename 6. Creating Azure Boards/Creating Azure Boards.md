Scrum process

1. Create a scrum team - small group of people focused on achieving an object.
2. Gather requirements from the user not all at once. These would probably taken as user stories.  This will be a continues process.
3. User stories will be translated to a items need to be accomplished as part of a product backlog.
4. Take the items from the PB and put it into multiple sprints as a part of a spring backlog. Multiple Sprints that will be used for implementing the application itself.
5. Continual basis you will go ahead an check the status of your sprints.


To track all of these we need a software/tool , that is called Azure Boards.



Lab

 When we signed up for the Azure DevOps, it would have created for us something known as an organization.

Within the Organization it would have created a Project.

 Organization settings - relevant to Organization

Project settings - associated to Project Settings

Azure Boards is the place to plan out work items.

You wanted to create a user story, you will create a work item within a project.

Wok process model should be agile/scrum.

we can create multiple project under one organization.

Project - this provides a place for storing the source code. Here users can plan, track progress and collaborate.

When you create a project, a team of same name as the project is created.



Organization - this can contain a group of related projects. Ex. you could have an organization for each business unit.

Combine the user stories into Epic, it is a larger body of work that can be broken down into task, small number of tasks, which in turn are user stories.

What ever user story we are adding ti should be a child of the Epic.
