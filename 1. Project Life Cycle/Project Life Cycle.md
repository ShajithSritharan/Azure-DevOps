IT organization is responsible for maintaining all of the IT applications and infrastructure for different business units.

Ex.

business unit comes to your company with a requirement saying that they want to have an application, that application have certain functionality/ features are defined by their users. the department users.

So your company's responsibility to develop your application and deploy the application. To preform this you need to put a project put into the place. The project would have certain requirements You gather the certain requirement from users.

then you would have a design document, developers and project managers assigned to the project.

Then you go ahead with development and deployment of the  application.



## Waterfall-Model
Advantages

1. Clear demarcation between one phase an other. one phase to gather all of the requirements, once the phase is complete you go for analysis phase.
2. You have the opportunity to solidify all of your requirements upfront itself.
3. It gives the Project manager a clear insights, introspects such as delivery dates, cost estimates etc.


Disadvantages

1. The customer might get to see the end product only at the end of the entire lifecycle. Collection of all of the phases take 3 months - 2/more years. If it's complex project it takes time to gather all of the requirements , it takes time to analyze, design and code. 
2. changes in scope. you have clear demarcation between two phases. Your users might start adding more requirements. you might tell `there's` a cut-off when it comes to the requirements phase. you can not stop users giving you further requirements. the amount of time it takes to go through each of the phases is high.
3. Bugs in the testing phase.
